# Summary

This is a mock analysis to explore whether production factors (budget, runtime) have any relationship with IMDb movie ratings.

# Introduction

IMDb ratings are often seen as a proxy for movie quality. In this report, we investigate whether movie characteristics like runtime or budget are associated with higher ratings.

# Methods and Results

We load a small movie dataset and visualize the relationship between runtime and ratings.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

movies <- read_csv("data/raw.csv")
head(movies)

ggplot(movies, aes(x = runtime, y = rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Runtime vs. IMDb Rating")
```

# Discussion

This mock analysis shows a weak visual relationship, but this is placeholder content. A full project would involve fitting a model and testing assumptions.
